User's manual on how to run the progam:

Step 1) Run orgin_server.py first, then proxy_server.py, and then client.py (in that order).

Step 2) On the client side of the program, make a request by typing in the name of a file.
        The name of the file entered must only be the name with no slashes or file type.
        For example: /HelloWorld.html will be entered as HelloWorld.
                     /sample-webpage.html will be enterd as sample-webpage.
        The client handles putting the forward slash and html file type. 
        If the file name is entered incorrectly, it will genereate status code 404. 

Step 3) Repeat step 2 to make subsequent file requests. 

Step 4) Exit the program manually to stopping the program.

As a note for the client.py file, since the program is multi-threaded as well, a response from the
proxy_server.py may not be displayed until entering a new pathname. Since Python threading can 
be unpredictable, there is no way of determining if a request for a new pathname or a response
from the proxy_server.py will occur.
