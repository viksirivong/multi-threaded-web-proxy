User's manual on how to run the progam:

Step 1) Run orgin_server.py first, then proxy_server.py and then client.py.

Step 2) On the client side of the program, make a request by typing in the name of a file.

Step 3) Another file can be requested one after the other if needed.

Step 3) We then receive a response from the proxy server which we can see on client.py.

Step 4) We can then send another request to the proxy server by repeating step 2.

Step 5) Once we are done with the program, we exit the program manually by stopping the program
